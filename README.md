## Explain Version Control

  Version Control is a software tool that helps software teams manage changes to source code over time. It keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database and helps developers fix mistakes while minimizing disruption to all team members.

## Explain the Difference Between Git and GitHub

  Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.

- While

  GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its features. It is a cloud-based service that hosts Git repositories and offers more features and resources than Git.

- Here is the Difference between Git and GitHub
  S.No. Git GitHub

1. Git is a software. GitHub is a service.
2. Git is a command-line tool. GitHub is a graphical user interface.
3. Git is installed locally on the system. GitHub is hosted on the web.
4. Git is maintained by Linux. GitHub is maintained by Microsoft.
5. Git is focused on version control and code sharing. GitHub is focused on centralized source code hosting.
6. Git is a version control system to manage source code history. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.
7. Git has no user management feature. GitHub has a built-in user management feature.
8. Git is open-source licensed. GitHub includes a free tier and a pay-for-use tier.
9. Git has minimal external tool configuration. GitHub has an active marketplace for tool integration.
10. Git provides a Desktop interface named Git Gui. GitHub provides a Desktop interface named GitHub Desktop.
11. Git competes with CVS, Azure DevOps Server, Subversion, Mercurial, etc. GitHub competes with GitLab, Bit Bucket, AWS Code Commit, etc.

## Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull

  Git fetch downloads the latest changes from the remote repository to your local repository, but it does not merge them with your local branch.

- While

  Git pull, on the other hand, gets the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them with your local branch.

## Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command

  Git rebase is a Git command that allows you to move or combine commits to a new base commit and rewrite history. Git rebase takes a set of commits, “copies” them, and then “pastes” them onto a new base.

- Here Is the Command For Git Rebase
  `git checkout <branch_name>`
  `git rebase <new_base>`

## Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command

  Git cherry-pick is a Git command that allows you to apply the changes made in one or more existing commits to a different branch. Git cherry-pick creates a new commit with the changes from the original commit(s).

- Here Is the Command For Git Cherry-Pick
  `git checkout <target_branch>`
  `git cherry-pick <commit_hash>`

## Write an article on Medium that explains the difference between let, const, and var

  `var` is a keyword used to declare variables in JavaScript. It is globally scoped or function scoped, meaning that it can be accessed from anywhere within the function or the window. `var` variables can be re-declared and updated within their scope.

  `let` is a new keyword introduced in ES6 (ES2015) that can be used for variable declaration. It is a block-scoped, meaning it is only available within the block in which they are defined. `let` variables can be updated but not re-declared.

  `const` it is also a new keyword introduced with `let` in ES6 (ES2015) that can be used to declare variables. `const` variables cannot be updated or re-declared.
